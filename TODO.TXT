Possible:
-------------
Display guild info: add "<-info" button underneath add/remove buttons

-------------
Need help:
-------------
Extend skill/spell costs to > 100 correctly, need help of 1+1 wished player

-------------
Future considerations:
-------------
Need to give OK button in Info Dialogs the default focus or atleast
find a way to have the info box easily and quickly closed

Also, need "right-clicked" posibility, seems better than "row-activated", i.e.
double-click for skill/spell/race/guild info.
specially since double-click is already taken for guild addition/remove
